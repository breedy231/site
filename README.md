# Personal Website

This is my personal website, brought to you by Gatsby. I'm developing it on a Raspberry Pi 4.

# Notable Tools

* Built using Gatsby 5 / React 18 / Node 18.
* Hosted via Netlify.
* Requests made via Axios. 
* Prettier for linting. 

# Codespace support

This repo is setup to be run via Codespaces. To do that, click the button at the top of the page, and when the page is loaded you can run the site with `gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0`
