# Personal Website

This is my personal website, brought to you by Gatsby. I'm developing it on a Raspberry Pi 4.

# Notable Tools

- Built using Gatsby 5 / React 18 / Node 18.
- Hosted via Netlify.
- Requests made via Axios.
- Prettier for linting.
  - `yarn prettier --write .`

# OAuth Integration Testing

## Trakt API Integration

The "Now" page includes integration with Trakt.tv to display currently watching content. The OAuth flow requires testing and token management.

### Testing OAuth Flow

#### Option 1: Test on Production (Recommended)

```
https://brendantreed.com/now/?admin
```

- No additional configuration needed
- Click "Re-authenticate with Trakt" button
- Follow OAuth flow and copy new tokens to Netlify environment variables

#### Option 2: Test on Deploy Previews

For testing on deploy preview URLs:

1. **Add temporary redirect URI to Trakt app:**
   - Go to your Trakt.tv app settings
   - Add the deploy preview callback URL (shown in alert when clicking re-auth button)
   - Example: `https://deploy-preview-X--site.netlify.app/callback/trakt`

2. **Complete OAuth flow**
3. **Remove temporary URL** from Trakt app after testing

#### Option 3: Local Development

```bash
npm run develop
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/now/?admin
```

### Updating Environment Variables

After successful OAuth authentication:

1. **Copy the displayed tokens** from the callback page
2. **Go to Netlify Dashboard** → Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. **Update these variables:**
   ```
   GATSBY_TRAKT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_new_access_token
   GATSBY_TRAKT_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_new_refresh_token
   ```
4. **Trigger new deployment** for changes to take effect
5. **Verify** that the "Now" page shows Trakt data instead of 401 errors

### Troubleshooting OAuth

- **"Redirect URI malformed"**: Ensure the redirect URI in authorization request matches exactly in token exchange
- **401 errors**: Check that environment variables are updated and deployment completed
- **502 errors**: Verify Netlify functions are using modern syntax (`export default`, `new Response()`)
